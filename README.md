## N-Puzzle 

<ul style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: none;">

N Puzzle problem consist of N tiles where N can only be (2M-1) and a one empty tile in a square board. This square board is divided to square root of N+1 rows and columns (e.g. 8-Puzzle will have 3 rows and 3 columns square board). The tiles can be move if it is adjacent to empty tile. In other words, a tile only allowed to swap its position with empty tile if that tile is neighbor of empty tile. Purpose of the N Puzzle problem is reaching the goal state by changing the position of tiles. 

According to given initial state and goal state, algorithms are implemented, number of visited states are observed for each algorithm and compared for different test cases.

## Travelling Salesman 

<ul style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: none;">

Travelling salesman problem (TSP) tries to find shortest possible route among given cities. Salesman’s aim is that visit the all given cities and return the origin city with shortest route. It is a well-known algorithmic problem in the computer science. In this assignment, travelling salesman problem is solved with genetic algorithm.

### <i>Genetic Algorithm</i>

Genetic algorithm is a heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin. This algorithm is the process of natural selection. Fittest individuals are selected in order to produce child of next generation. 

There are 5 steps of the genetic algorithm in order to make an evolution.
  - Initial population
  - Fitness function
  - Selection
  - Crossover
  - Mutation

<br>

Population, Chromosomes and Genes 
  - A route can be thought as a <b>Chromosome</b>.
  - A city can be thought as a <b>Gene</b> of its chromosome.
  - All chromosomes can be thought as <b>Population</b> of that generation.

## Hand-written Digit Recognition

<ul style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: none;">
  
Handwritten digit recognition is one of the most well-known computer vision problem. The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. In other words, it is about prediction of handwritten digits (0-9). In this assignment, some Machine Learning algorithms are used to predict digits.

### <i>Algorithms</i>
  - K-Nearest Neighbor
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes

Test cases are applied with different parameters and results are analyzed.
